# Orthography & Phonology of Arcadia

Arcadia maintains a **one-to-one correspondence** between its written and spoken forms, ensuring clarity while allowing flexibility in accent variations.
The language uses **23 Latin letters**, excluding ⟨k⟩, ⟨q⟩, and ⟨w⟩, along with digraphs and well-defined stress rules to maintain uniformity.
From these letters, ⟨h⟩, ⟨x⟩, and ⟨y⟩ are only used as the second letter of a digraph.
There are **no silent letters or capitalization** in native Arcadian orthography, but **foreign spellings and standardized symbols** retain their original spelling.

A complete table of pronunciation for each letter and digraph can be found [here][letters].

!!! note "Pronunciation Flexibility"

    Arcadia allows a **broad range of phonetic variations** while maintaining core sounds.
    For example, ⟨r⟩ is pronounced as /ɾ/, but distinctions like trilled vs. tapped carry **no functional load**.
    The phonological system is designed for **cross-cultural accessibility**, ensuring natural variation.

Arcadia's punctuation system, along with the meanings of each mark, is detailed in the [Punctuation][punctuation] section.

## Accentuation

Monosyllabic words are **always stressed** on their sole syllable, eliminating the need for accent marks.
For multisyllabic words, stress can fall on the **ultimate, penultimate, or antepenultimate** syllable.

To minimize accents, only words **not stressed on the penultimate syllable** require marking.

- **No accent mark** → Stress defaults to the penultimate syllable (_ho.mis_ → /'homis/).
- **Acute accent (´)** → Marks a **non-penultimate stress** (_a.sé_ → /a'se/).

## Vowel Merging

Adjacent identical vowels **merge** (_mee_ → _mē_), but in casual text, merged vowels are typically written in their simplified form (_me_).
A **macron (¯)** is used only in **dictionaries or grammatical references** to indicate vowel merging.

## Punctuation

If a quoted sentence **ends with the same punctuation mark** as the main sentence, the punctuation is placed **outside** the quotation:

- ✅ _He said, "This is correct"._
- ❌ _He said, "This is correct."._
- ❌ _He said, "This is correct."_

## Loanwords & Names

Proper names that retain **standard Latin spelling** remain unchanged (_tokyo_), even if they contain ⟨k⟩, ⟨q⟩, or ⟨w⟩.
Also, standard units of measurement and symbols are used without modification, even if they contain capital letters, eg _kWh_.

To aid pronunciation, **IPA** may be used upon the first occurrence of such a name (_xavier /kseivieɾ/_).
