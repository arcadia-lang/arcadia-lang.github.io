=== "Arcadia"

    movaveme la solis adhlim on la matine.
    cantavunes es avisis aut mek fenestre.
    potavuno a teon i edravuno a panon ja a matitxene.
    pasavune mek vecinis con asék canis epi mek dome.
    on la vespere, jogavunes es pueresis on la vie.
    volaudhavuno multie misme canton.
    venavune la noctis, i apparavune las stellesis.

=== "English"

    The sun rises in the morning.
    Birds sing outside my window.
    I drink tea and eat bread for breakfast.
    My neighbour walks with his dog in front of my house.
    In the evening, children play in the street.
    I listen to the same song many times.
    Night comes, and the stars appear.
