=== "Explanation"

    1. _save marias du me amighon._
        - **translation:** Maria is my friend.
        - **notes:**
            - We use "du" for inalienable possession, as friendship is an inalienable relationship.
    1. _save de asé caros oceanadhi._
        - **translation:** Her car is blue.
    1. _estimave a pitxon._
        - **translation:** She likes pizza.
        - **notes:**
            - We use the weak indefinite article "a" because we're talking about pizza in a general sense.
    1. _vivave on e dome nebe la fluve._
        - **translation:** She lives in a house by the river.
    1. _save e canis de marie._
        - **translation:** She has a dog.
        - **notes:**
            - Literally "A dog is of Maria", as we don't have a verb for "to have".
    1. _suve du asé nomis rexi._
        - **translation:** Its name is Rex.
        - **notes:**
            - For names, we always use the veritas tense, as names are not subject to change.
