=== "Explanation"

    1. _vidivo veon on la bazhare._
        - **translation:** I saw you at the market.
        - **notes:**
            - We use the past tense because the story is narrated as of now, and the events have already happened.
    1. _obvendhivi es pomeson._
        - **translation:** You bought apples.
    1. _parlivo "salvuful", sed ne audhivi meon._
        - **translation:** I said "hello", but you did not hear me.
        - **notes:**
            - "salvuful" doesn't need an article, as named noun phrases act as proper nouns.
    1. _epi, convidhivos im la parce._
        - **translation:** Later, we met at the park.
        - **notes:**
            - "convidhivos" literally means "we saw each other".
            - We use "im" meaning inside, because we are referring to being inside the boundary of the park.
                "on" can also be used, but with a slightly different meaning, viewing the park as a landmark.
    1. _risivi, i conparlivos._
        - **translation:** You smiled, and we talked.
        - **notes:**
            - "conparlivos" literally means "we speak to each other".
    1. _sive e die boni._
        - **translation:** It was a good day.
