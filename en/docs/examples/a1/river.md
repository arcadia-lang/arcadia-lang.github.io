=== "Explanation"

    1. estave la solis lumini._
        - **translation:** The sun is bright.
        - **notes:**
            - We use "sir" instead of "estir", as brightness is a state, not a characteristic.
            - We use the present tense because the story is narrated as of the time happening.

        - **translation:** A child walks to the river.
    1. _vidhave e pescon magni._
        - **translation:** They see a big fish.
        - **notes:**
            - We use "vidhir", instead of "volvidhir", as the child wasn't actively pursuing to watch the fish.
