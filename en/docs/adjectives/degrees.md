# Adjective Degrees

Adjectives in Arcadia can express different degrees of comparison: **positive, comparative, and elative**.

## Positive Degree

The positive degree is the base form of the adjective, used to describe a quality **without any comparison**.

- _save marias juvi._
    - **translation:** Maria is young.

## Comparative Degree

The comparative degree is used to **compare two nouns**.
In Arcadia, it can be a comparative of **equality**, **superiority**, or **inferiority**.

- **Superiority**:
    - _meaning_: The first noun has the quality to **a greater extent** than the second noun.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-eli
    - _analytic_: veli <adjective>

- **Equality**:
    - _meaning_: The first noun has the quality to **the same extent** as the second noun.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-ali
    - _analytic_: vali <adjective>

- **Inferiority**:
    - _meaning_: The first noun has the quality to **a lesser extent** than the second noun.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-oli
    - _analytic_: voli <adjective>

| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Superiority | _save marias juveli to adame_ | _save marias veli juvi to adame_ | Maria is younger than Adam |
| Equality    | _save marias juvali to adame_ | _save marias vali juvi to adame_ | Maria is as young as Adam  |
| Inferiority | _save marias juvoli to adame_ | _save marias voli juvi to adame_ | Maria is older than Adam   |

## Superlative Degree

Arcadia doesn't have a proper superlative degree. This is a feature of the language. The superlative meaning is essentially covered by the comparative degree, when compared to a group of nouns.

| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Superiority | _save marias juveli tole asék amighe_ | _save marias veli juvi tole asék amighe_ | Maria is the youngest among her friends |
| Equality    | _save marias juvali tole asék amighe_ | _save marias vali juvi tole asék amighe_ | Maria is as young as her friends        |
| Inferiority | _save marias juvoli tole asék amighe_ | _save marias voli juvi tole asék amighe_ | Maria is the oldest among her friends   |

## Elative Degree

The elative degree is used to indicate that the noun has the quality to **the greatest or least extent**, in an **absolute form**, without comparison to other nouns.
Both of them have a **synthetic** and an **analytic** form.

- **Superiority**:
    - _meaning_: The noun has the quality to the greatest extend.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-ili
    - _analytic_: vili <adjective>

- **Inferiority**:
    - _meaning_: The noun has the quality to the lowest extend.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-uli
    - _analytic_: vuli <adjective>

| Form                   | Arcadia Synthetic    | Arcadia Analytic        | English                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Superiority (absolute) | _save marias juvili_ | _save marias vili juvi_ | Maria is the youngest possible    |
| Inferiority (absolute) | _save marias juvuli_ | _save marias vuli juvi_ | Maria is the least young possible |
