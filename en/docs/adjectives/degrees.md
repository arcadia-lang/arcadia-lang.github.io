# Adjective Degrees

Adjectives in Arcadia can express different degrees of comparison: **positive, comparative, and superlative**.

## Positive Degree

The positive degree is the base form of the adjective, used to describe a quality **without any comparison**.

- _save marias juvi._
    - **translation:** Maria is young.

## Comparative Degree

The comparative degree is used to **compare two nouns**.
In Arcadia, we have a **positive**, a **neutral** and a **negative** form.

- **Positive**:
    - _meaning_: The first noun has the quality to **a greater extent** than the second noun.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-eli
    - _analytic_: veli <adjective>

- **Neutral**:
    - _meaning_: The first noun has the quality to **the same extent** as the second noun.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-ali
    - _analytic_: vali <adjective>

- **Negative**:
    - _meaning_: The first noun has the quality to **a lesser extent** than the second noun.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-oli
    - _analytic_: voli <adjective>

| -------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Positive | _save marias juveli to adamos_ | _save marias veli juvi to adamos_ | Maria is younger than Adam |
| Neutral  | _save marias juvali to adamos_ | _save marias vali juvi to adamos_ | Maria is as young as Adam  |
| Negative | _save marias juvoli to adamos_ | _save marias voli juvi to adamos_ | Maria is older than Adam   |

## Superlative Degree

The superlative degree is used to describe **the highest (or lowest) degree** of a quality amongst a group.
Both of them have a **synthetic** and an **analytic** form.

- **Positive**:
    - _meaning_: The noun has the quality to the greatest extend.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-ili
    - _analytic_: vili <adjective>

- **Negative**:
    - _meaning_: The noun has the quality to the lowest extend.
    - _synthetic_: <adjective>-uli
    - _analytic_: vuli <adjective>

The superlative degree can be used to indicate that the noun has the quality to **the greatest or least extent**, in an **absolute form**, without comparison to other nouns.
This is formed by using the superlative as a predicate, **without any articles**.
