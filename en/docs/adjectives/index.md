# Adjectives

Adjectives in Arcadia decline exactly the same as nouns do.
Suffixes are added to change the [**degree**][degree] of the adjective, or for [**intensification**][intensification].
They are placed after the noun that the describe in order of importance, for example both mean "big new knife":

- _ye coltis magnis novis_
- _ye coltis novis magnis_

There is an slight difference in intention.
The first means that it's a big new knife, but the second means the knife is noticeably new, and maybe so shiny that you'll notice this first.

The number, case, and class of the adjective always agrees with the nouns that it modifies:

- _ye furcis i ye coclis magnisis_
    - **translation:** a big fork and a big spoon

- _ye furcis i ye coclis magnis_
    - **translation:** a fork and a big spoon

If an adjective needs to modify multiple adjectives that belong to different classes, the class of the adjective is the same as the class of the closest noun.

## Examples

- _save la domis magnis es beli._
    - **translation:** the big house is beautiful.

- _save la domis es magni i beli._
    - **translation:** the house is big and beautiful.
