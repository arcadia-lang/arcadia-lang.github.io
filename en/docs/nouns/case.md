# Cases

Arcadia employs **thirteen grammatical cases**, each marked by a distinct suffix.
These cases define the **syntactic role** of a noun within a sentence, facilitating a focus-based, Austronesian-inspired alignment system.

## Case Suffixes

- **Nominative (-is)**: Marks the focused argument of the sentence.
- **Ergative (-er)**: Marks the unfocused actor of action verbs.
- **Absolutive (-it)**: Marks the unfocused experiencer of experiential verbs.
- **Accusative (-on)**: Marks the unfocused patient of action verbs.
- **Dative (-il)**: Marks the unfocused receiver of action verbs.
- **Thematic (-ath)**: Marks the unfocused stimulus of experiential verbs.
- **Genitive (-ek)**: Marks the alienable possessor of a noun.
- **Essential (-em)**: Marks the inalienable possessor of a noun.
- **Thematic (-ath)**: Marks the unfocused stimulus of experiential verbs.
- **Predicative (-i)**: Marks the predicate of a linking verb.
- **Prepositional (-e)**: Used after prepositions to indicate location or relation.
- **Vocative (-o)**: Used for direct address.
- **Instrumental (-a)**: Marks the instrument of an action.
- **Benefactive (-u)**: Marks the beneficiary of an action.

## Vowel Merging Rules

In Arcadia, all noun stems **end in a vowel**, determined by the noun's grammatical class.
Case suffixes **begin with a vowel**, and specific merging rules apply when a noun stem's final vowel interacts with a case suffix's initial vowel to ensure phonological consistency:

- **Front Vowels (-i, -e)**: No merging occurs when the noun stem ends in a front vowel.
- **Back Vowels (-a, -o, -u)**:
    - **Bipartite Cases (nominative, ergative, absolutive, accusative, dative, thematic, genitive, essential)**: The case suffix's vowel is dropped, retaining the stem's vowel (e.g., _luna-il_ → _lunal_).
    - **Monopartite Cases (predicative, prepositional, vocative, instrumental, benefactive)**: The stem's final vowel is dropped, retaining the case suffix's vowel (e.g., _luna-i_ → _luni_).

In non-singular numbers, there is no merging, as the number suffix always ends in a consonant.
