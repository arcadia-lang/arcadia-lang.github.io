# Nouns

Nouns form the **foundation** of Arcadia's grammar, classified based on their **characteristics and usage**.

### **Specificity-Based Classification**

Arcadia distinguishes nouns by their **degree of specificity**:

- **Proper nouns** → Refer to a **unique entity** (_Arcadia, Maria_).
- **Common nouns** → Describe a **general concept** (_tree, apple_).

### **Gender and Optional Prefixes**

Arcadia is **not a gendered language**, though **gender prefixes** may be used for clarity.
These prefixes are **optional** and serve only as **contextual markers**, not as grammatical necessities.
More details on **gender handling** are available in the **[gender guide][gender]**.

### **Grammatical Classes**

Arcadia classifies nouns into **five grammatical [classes][class]**, which serve a **structural role** with **no semantic influence**:

- **-i class**
- **-e class**
- **-a class**
- **-o class**
- **-u class**

### **Grammatical Number System**

Arcadia recognizes **countability distinctions**, influencing noun behaviour in pluralization and measurement:

- **Countable nouns** → Can be **enumerated** (_three apples, half an hour_).
- **Uncountable nouns** → Cannot be **individually counted** (_water, love_).

Further, there are **five grammatical [numbers][number]**.

### **Case System**

Arcadia employs **eleven grammatical cases**, defining each noun's **role within a sentence**.
Details on their functions and interactions can be found in the **[case guide][case]**.
