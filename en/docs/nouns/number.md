# Number

Numbers are formed by adding a **suffix** to the root word.
The semantic meaning of the suffix **varies** depending on whether the noun is **countable or uncountable**.

## **Countable Nouns**

Countable nouns are those that can be **quantified as discrete units**, such as apples, kilograms, and humans.
Using **"libri"** (_book_), here are the suffixes:

| Number     | Suffix | Example | Meaning                                      |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Singular   | —Ø     | libri   | "exactly one book"                           |
| Fractional | -d     | librid  | "part of a book" (<1 unit)                   |
| Plural     | -s     | libris  | "books" (>1, decimals and fractions allowed) |
| Nullar     | -n     | librin  | "no books"                                   |
| Total      | -l     | libril  | "all books"                                  |

**Negative quantities** take the **same suffix** as their positive counterpart.

## **Uncountable Nouns**

| Number     | Suffix | Example | Meaning                     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | --------------------------- |
| Singular   | —Ø     | amore   | "love" (unspecified amount) |
| Fractional | -d     | amored  | "a little love"             |
| Plural     | -s     | amores  | "abundant love"             |
| Nullar     | -n     | amoren  | "no love"                   |
| Total      | -r     | amorer  | "all love"                  |
