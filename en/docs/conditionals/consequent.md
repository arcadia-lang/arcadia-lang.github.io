# Then clause variation

In Arcadia the then particle is mandatory in conditionals, even when it precedes the if clause.
There are the 3 different ways to express then:

- **is,** which is used when the conditional an scientific implication.
- **es,** which is used when the conditional the implication strength is strong.
- **us,** which is used when the conditional the implication strength is weaker.

## Biscuit conditionals

Biscuit conditionals are a special case in Arcadia, as they are not true conditionals.
In conditionals, the if/then clauses are both expressed with the main hypermood, but in the case of biscuit conditionals, the if part is using the secondary hypermood.
Furthermore, the then part is not using a particle.

- _stataves es biskotisis super la mese, ef volake aliame_
    - **translation:** There are cookies on the table, if you want some.

## Examples

1.  _ef jogagos, es vincavo._
    - **translation:** If we play, I will win.
    - **explanation:** "is" is reserved for proofs.

1.  _ef jogagos, us vincavo._
    - **translation:** If we play, I expect to win.
    - **explanation:** "us" still means that this is the expected outcome.

# Else clause variation

In Arcadia the else clause isn't mandatory in conditionals, and conditionals that are introduced with "ef" cannot have an else clause.

- **il,** which is used when the conditional an scientific implication. It can only be used with "(u)celo".
- **el,** which is used when the conditional the implication strength is strong.
- **ul,** which is used when the conditional the implication strength is weaker.
