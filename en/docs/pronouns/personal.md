# Personal Pronouns

Arcadia recognizes **three core personal pronouns**, corresponding to **first, second, and third persons**.
The **fourth person** serves a **generalized reference**, expressing **all objects or none**—it is handled through **indefinite pronouns**, rather than a distinct personal form.

## Pronoun Overview

| ------ | ------- |
| 1st    | me      |

| 3rd    | asé     |
