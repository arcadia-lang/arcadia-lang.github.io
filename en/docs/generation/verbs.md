# Verbs

## Focus shift

In Arcadia the base form of a verb has the default focus.

- Experience verbs have experiencer focus
- Action verbs have actor focus

There is neither a "take" nor a "buy" verb.
The focus shift allows creating such verbs.

- **Patient Focus:** "re-" prefix
- **Receiver Focus:** "ob-" prefix

1.  _potavo ye akvon._
    - **translation:** I'm drinking water.

1.  _repotave ye akvis mer._
    - **translation:** Water is being drunk by me.

1.  _donavo la libron veil._
    - **translation:** I am giving the book to you.

1.  _redonave la libris mer veil._
    - **translation:** The book is being given from me to you.

1.  _obdonavis la libron mer._
    - **translation:** You are receiving a book from me.

## Reflexivity

Base verbs are also never reflexive or reciprocal.
A prefix changes the verb in a reflexive or a reciprocal form.

- **reflexive:** "aut-" prefix
- **reciprocal:** "con-" prefix

1.  _autamoraves adamo i maria._
    - **translation:** Adam and Maria love themselves.

1.  _conamoraves adamo i maria._
    - **translation:** Adam and Maria love each other.

An important case is the generation of verbs like "to trade", from "to sell".

## Senses

Base sense verbs are used when the subject has the ability to perform the action.
Arcadia can generate verbs via prefix that are used when the subject active uses their sense.
This is analogous to "to see" -> "to watch".

Arcadia also allows creating intrasitive verbs for senses.
This is analogous to "to hear" -> "to sound".

- **voluntary action:** "vol-" prefix
- **intrasitive:** "per-" prefix

1.  _vidavo ye pescis._
    - **translation:** I see a fish.

1.  _volaudavo ye canto._
    - **translation:** I am listening to a song.

1.  _perolfave la uovos malie._
    - **translation:** The egg smells bad.
