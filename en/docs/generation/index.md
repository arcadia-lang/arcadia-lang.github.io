# Generation

Understanding Arcadia's **etymological principles** is essential for generating new words effectively.

Since Arcadia's vocabulary is **smaller than in most languages**, word generation occurs more frequently.
The system is designed to **minimize lexical gaps**, ensuring that necessary words can always be formed.

Most words originate from **verbs**, making **verb-based derivation** a key process.
This section is divided based on the **resulting word type**:

- **[Verbs][verbs]**
- **[Nouns][nouns]**

[verbs]: ./verbs.md
[nouns]: ./nouns.md
