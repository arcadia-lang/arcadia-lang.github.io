# Prepositions

All prepositions are always used with the **absolutive case**.

## Viewpoint prepositions

- **en:** sets the observer

The default viewpoint is the **speaker's**.
In order to **set a different viewpoint**, we use "_en_".
For example, "_en la dome_" means as viewed **from the house**.

## Spatiotemporal movement prepositions

- **ec:** from
- **adh:** to
- **trans:** throughout, all the way through

These prepositions indicate movement away **from or towards a reference point** in space or time.
They can be used **independently or in combination** with other prepositions to specify **directionality**.

## Spatial (curve-defined) prepositions

- **im:** inside
- **aut:** outside
- **sam:** on the same side
- **oth:** on the other side
- **lim:** on boundary

There is a natural curve surrounding objects, **the horizon**.
Therefore, we use "_eclim_" and "_adhlim_" to indicate the rising and setting of **celestial objects**.

## Spatial (curve-defined) movement prepositions

These are used to indicate the **clockwise or counter-clockwise movement** while traversing a curve.
They are more general and are **not limited to circular paths**, but they are defined by whether the movement has **the interior** on the **left-hand side** or on the **right-hand side**.

- **deth:** clockwise along boundary
- **leth:** counter-clockwise along boundary

## Spatial/temporal prepositions

- **ap:** above/on top of/on
- **sub:** under/underneath

- **lejo:** left of
- **decs:** right of

- **epi:** in front of (temporal: after)
- **pro:** behind (temporal: before)

- **nebe:** against/next to
- **gege:** opposite of

- **um:** around
- **on:** in/on/at a location or time
- **inter:** between (exclusive)
- **interim:** between (inclusive)
- **cui:** every (e.g., every 2 minutes, every 3 meters)
- **dum:** during

Temporally, _epi_ means **after the reference point**, and _pro_ means before it.
We use the same viewpoint for spatial _epi_ and _pro_, ie _epi en la dome_ is **more accurately** translated as "after the house" close to what we mean by "behind the house".

## Instrumental prepositions

- **per:** by the means of
- **con:** with
- **sin:** without

## Causal prepositions

- **ja:** for (purpose)
- **por:** for (beneficiary)
- **anstata:** instead of
- **chor:** except for
- **lau:** according to
- **anti:** against (e.g., against the rules)

## Relational prepositions

- **de:** of (inalienable possession)
- **du:** of (alienable possession)
- **pri:** about, concerning, on the subject of, regarding
- **meta:** self-referentially, about itself

## Examples

1.  _jogavul puerilis on la dome._
    - **translation:** All the children are playing in the house.
    - **explanation:** The house is viewed as a location, so we use "on" not "im".

1.  _manerovas im la dome._
    - **translation:** We'll stay at home.
    - **explanation:** The house is viewed as a building, defined by its surrounding walls, so we use "im" not "on".
