# Questions

Questions in Arcadia are formed using a **question particle**, followed by sentence **with the unknown part omitted**.

- **Yes/no questions** → Indicated by **rising intonation** in spoken Arcadia.
- **Open-ended questions** → Use **interrogative particles**, which combine with **prepositions and declensions** as expected.
- All **interrogatives** are **affirmative** by default.

## **Question Particles**

| **Particle** | **English**       | **Meaning**      |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **cun**      |                   | Yes/no question  |
| **cuaghir**  |                   | Action inquiry   |
| **cuídh**    | Who/what          | Generic inquiry  |
| **cuál**     | Which             | Choice selection |
| **cubi**     | Where             | Location-based   |
| **cuandho**  | When              | Time reference   |
| **cuót**     | How much/how many | Quantity inquiry |
| **cume**     | How               | Manner inquiry   |

- **Interrogative words can combine with prepositions**, allowing **expanded meanings**:
    - _ja cuídh_ → "Why"
    - _por cuídh_ → "For whose benefit"

!!! note "Handling Unknowns"

    In Arcadia, asking a question **causes affected suffixes to drop**:

        - **"cuót"** removes **quantity markers**, simplifying nouns.
        - **"cuandho"** drops **time suffixes** when asking about duration.
        - **"cuídh"** removes **person suffixes** when querying the subject of a verb.
