# Possessives

Arcadia uses the **genitive** and **essential cases** to express possession, and distinguishes between **alienable** and **inalienable** possession.
The owner **follows** the owned item in both cases, but allows for **possessor-first ordering** for emphasis.
**Possessives can function as determiners**, appearing **before the noun**, but this can happen only when the **possessor is a pronoun** and there is **no possession chain**.

### **Alienable vs. Inalienable Possession**

- **Essential case** → Marks **inalienable possession**, where the possessor is **an integral part** of the possessed.
- **Genitive case** → Marks **alienable possession**, where the possessor is **not inherently connected** to the possessed.

## **Examples**

- **Alienable attributive determiner**
    - _save mek libris magni_ → **"My book is big."**
    - _save la libris mek magni_ → **"My book is big."**
    - **Explanation:** The book **is not inherently a part** of the speaker.

- **Inalienable attributive determiner**
    - _save la parenis la filiem mem adamo_ → **"The father of my child is Adam."**
    - **Explanation:** The child's relationship to the father **is inherent**.
    - **Explanation:** Ownership chain does not allow _mem_ to function as a determiner.

- **Predicative Possessive**
    - _save la libris mek_ → **"The book is mine."**
