# Demonstratives

Arcadia has three **bound deixis elements**, that are **never used alone**.
Instead, they **attach to interrogatives** to add **spatial or temporal deixis**, specifying proximity or distance.

The **three levels of deixis** are:

- **_est:_** Close (near the speaker).
- **_ess:_** Far (visible but distant).
- **_tis:_** Very far or invisible (out of sight, abstract, or distant in time).

Since **est, ess, and tis** are dependent modifiers, they **cannot appear independently** in speech or writing.
They always require an **interrogative base** to function correctly.

### **Interrogative Demonstratives**

Deixis elements are combined with **interrogatives** to form precise demonstratives:

| **Particle** | **English**       | **Meaning**      |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **cuíd**     | Who/what          | Generic inquiry  |
| **cuál**     | Which             | Choice selection |
| **cubi**     | Where             | Location-based   |
| **cuandho**  | When              | Time reference   |
| **cuót**     | How much/how many | Quantity inquiry |
| **cume**     | How               | Manner inquiry   |

- **_cuíd:_** (who/what)
    - **Close:** _estuídh_ → "This"
    - **Far:** _essuídh_ → "That"
    - **Very far/invisible:** _tisuídh_ → "The one that's out of my sight"

- **_cuál:_** (which)
    - **Close:** _estuál_ → "This one"
    - **Far:** _essuál_ → "That one"
    - **Very far/invisible:** _tisuál_ → "The one that's out of my sight"

- **_cubi:_** (where)
    - **Close:** _estubi_ → "Here"
    - **Far:** _essubi_ → "There"
    - **Very far/invisible:** _tisubi_ → "The place that's out of sight"

- **_cuandho:_** (when)
    - **Close:** _estuandho_ → "Now"
    - **Far:** _essuandho_ → "The other time"
    - **Very far/invisible:** _tisuandho_ → "In a distant time"

- **_cuót:_** (how much/how many)
    - **Close:** _estuót_ → "This much"
    - **Far:** _essuót_ → "That much"
    - **Very far/invisible:** _tisuót_ → "That much"

- **_cume:_** (how)
    - **Close:** _estume_ → "This way"
    - **Far:** _essume_ → "That way"
    - **Very far/invisible:** _tisume_ → "That way"

!!! note "Deictic Expressions"

    _"-ove"_, _"-uandho"_, and _"-ume"_ are **not true demonstratives**, but are included here due to their close relationship with **deictic expressions**.

## **Agreement Rules**

- When combined with a noun, **the demonstrative must agree in number**.
- Demonstratives **do not take case markings** when used with a noun (to avoid redundancy).
- When **used independently**, case marking **is mandatory**.

## **"ess" vs. "tis" in Temporal Contexts**

- **"essandho"** → Used when referring to **a time within a lifetime**.
- **"tisandho"** → Used when referring to **a more distant time or an abstract concept**.

## **Examples**

- **Demonstrative with a noun** → No case marking required:
    - _estuídh pomos_ → **"This apple"**
    - _estuídhes pomosis_ → **"These apples"**
    - _estuál pomos_ → **"This one from the apples"** (choosing among apples)
    - _estót aguas_ → **"This much water"**

- **Demonstrative as a standalone pronoun** → Requires case marking:
    - _volavo essuídhon._ → **"I want that."** (Case marking required)
    - _volavo tisuídhon._ → **"I want the one that's out of sight."**
