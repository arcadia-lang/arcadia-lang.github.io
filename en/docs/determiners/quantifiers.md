# Quantifiers

Quantifiers are **determiners** that indicate the **quantity of a noun**.

- **Nullar and total numbers** → Naturally make **"all" and "none" redundant**, simplifying expressions.
- **Usage Restrictions** → **Quantifiers cannot be used with uncountable nouns**, since the **number already conveys quantity**.

## **Core Quantifiers**

Arcadia defines the following **quantifiers**:

- **_poco_** → **"A few"** (small but distinct amount).
- **_aliamo_** → **"Some"** (can refer to one or multiple).
- **_oliamo_** → **"Some"** (cannot refer to one, only plural).
- **_multo_** → **"Many"** (large quantity).
- **_cisco_** → **"Each"** (individual emphasis).

## **Usage Notes**

- **"aliamo"** → Even though it **can refer to one**, it always **takes a plural noun form**.
- **"cisco"** →
    - Used with nouns in **singular form** to highlight **individual entities**.
    - Used with nouns in **total form** to emphasize **both individuals and the group**.

## **Combination with interrogatives**

These quantifiers can **combine with interrogative words** to form **quantified replies**.
For example, combining with **"cuandho"** (when) produces:

- **_pocuandho_** → **"A few times"**
- **_oliamuandho_** → **"Sometimes (not just one time)"**
- **_multuandho_** → **"Many times"**
- **_ciscuandho_** → **"Each time"**

## **Examples**

- **Total Focus (`pueri` in total form)**
    - _edravul puerelis ye pomon_ → **"Every child is eating an apple."**
    - **Explanation:** The **total form** and verb highlight **the group as a whole**.

- **Singular Emphasis (`cisco` with singular form)**
    - _edrave cisco pueris ye pomon_ → **"Each child is eating an apple."**
    - **Explanation:** The verb and noun remain **singular**, focusing on **individual children**.

- **Hybrid Emphasis (`cisco` with total form)**
    - _edravul cisco puerelis ye pomon_ → **"Each and every child is eating an apple."**
    - **Explanation:** The **total form + cisco** highlights **both individuals and the group**.
