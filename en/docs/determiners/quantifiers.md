# Quantifiers

Quantifiers are **determiners** that indicate the **quantity of a noun**.

- **Nullar and total numbers** → Naturally make **"all" and "none" redundant**, simplifying expressions.
- **Usage Restrictions** → **Quantifiers cannot be used with uncountable nouns**, since the **number already conveys quantity**.

### **Core Quantifiers**

Arcadia defines the following **quantifiers**:

- **_poco_** → **"A few"** (small but distinct amount).
- **_aliame_** → **"Some"** (can refer to one or multiple).
- **_oliame_** → **"Some"** (cannot refer to one, only plural).
- **_multe_** → **"Many"** (large quantity).
- **_cisca_** → **"Each"** (individual emphasis).

### **Usage Notes**

- **"aliame"** → Even though it **can refer to one**, it always **takes a plural noun form**.
- **"cisca"** →
    - Used with nouns in **singular form** to highlight **individual entities**.
    - Used with nouns in **total form** to emphasize **both individuals and the group**.

## **Examples**

- **Total Focus (`pueri` in total form)**
    - _edravul puerelis ye pomon_ → **"Every child is eating an apple."**
    - **Explanation:** The **total form** and verb highlight **the group as a whole**.

- **Singular Emphasis (`cisca` with singular form)**
    - _edrave cisca pueris ye pomon_ → **"Each child is eating an apple."**
    - **Explanation:** The verb and noun remain **singular**, focusing on **individual children**.

- **Hybrid Emphasis (`cisca` with total form)**
    - _edravul cisca puerelis ye pomon_ → **"Each and every child is eating an apple."**
    - **Explanation:** The **total form + cisca** highlights **both individuals and the group**.
