# Determiners

Determiners are words that precede a noun, providing additional information about which object we are talking about.
Arcadia has six types of determiners:

- [Articles][article]:
    - Define specificity: _the_ tree, _an_ apple.
- [Demonstrative determiners][demonstrative determiner]:
    - Indicate proximity: _this_ machine, _that_ person.
- [Interrogative determiners][interrogative determiner]:
    - Used in questions: _which_ book, _what_ blanket.
- [Possessives][possessive]:
    - Express ownership: _Maria's_ bag, _my_ bed.
- [Quantifiers][quantifier]:
    - Define rough quantities: _a few_ dogs, _each_ child.
- [Numerals][numeral]:
    - Define exact numbers: _two_ dolphins, _a million_ dollars.

## Further Details

Determiners can be combined when it enhances clarity or adds emphasis, as in "my three best friends" or "the three musketeers."
In general, nouns in Arcadia require a determiner, unless the noun is inherently specific, such as a proper noun or one in the nullar or total number.
