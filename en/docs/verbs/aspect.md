# Aspect

In Arcadia there are 4 aspect suffixes, which are used to indicate how the verb's action extends over time.

## Parts of the aspect suffix

The aspect suffixes are:

- **Perfect:** "il", used for actions that have finished
- **Prospective:** "ol", used for actions that haven't started yet
- **Continuous:** "am", used for actions that are in running continuously
- **Iterative:** "em", used for actions that run on intervals
- **Habitual:** "un", used for actions that are habitual

The aspect suffixes can be combined with each other to create more complex meanings.
The resulting suffix is formed by concatenating the individual suffixes.

The order of the suffixes is important, as it affects the meaning of the resulting aspect. The order is:

1. Perfect/Prospective (il/ol)
2. Continuous/Iterative (am/em)
3. Habitual (uny)

!!! note "veritas"

    Veritas has no aspect, as it describes events and truths unaffected by time.
