# Mood

In Arcadia, we have two **hypermoods**, the **main** and the **subordinate**.
The **main moods** are the moods that only have an **inflectional form**, but the **subordinate moods** have a **periphrastic form** as well.
The inflectional forms are created by **adding a suffix** after the tense suffix.

## Hypermoods

Arcadia has two hypermoods: the **main** and the **subordinate**.
Their role is to express whether the verb is being used as the main verb or in a subordinate clause.
The subordinate hypermood is characterised by changing unvoicing of the final consonant of the mood suffix.

## Moods

All moods, apart from the **indicative** and the **conditional**, have both an inflectional and a periphrastic form.
The periphrastic forms are created by using auxiliary verbs, and they are used for mood stacking.

### Indicative mood

The indicative mood is used **to express facts**, and it's using the consonant "v" ("f" as a subordinate).

### Conditional mood

The conditional mood is used **to express hypothetical situations**, and it's using the consonant "g" ("k" as a subordinate). If the hypothesis is a **counterfactual**, the consonant changes to "gh" ("kh" as a subordinate).

### Imperative mood

Imperative mood is used **to express commands**, and it's using the consonants "d" ("t" as a subordinate).

### Obligative Mood

The obligative mood expresses **necessity or obligation**, and it's using the consonant "dh" ("th" as a subordinate).
It's also used to express **duty, destiny, or social obligation**.
Duty and social obligation use the **veritas tense**, and destiny uses the **future**.

Negating a verb in the obligative mood means that you don't have the obligation, rather than meaning you must not perform the action.

### Permissive Mood

The permissive mood expresses the action of the verb is permitted, and it's using the consonant "zh" ("sh" as a subordinate).

### Potential Mood

The potential mood expresses the ability or possibility to do something, and it's using the consonant "z" ("s" as a subordinate).

### Optative Mood

The optative mood expresses wishes, desires, or hopes, and it's using the consonant "b" ("p" as a subordinate).

### Dubitative mood

The dubitative mood expresses doubt or scepticism about the action, and it's using the consonant "dx" ("tx" as a subordinate).

### Evidential mood

Evidential expresses different levels of evidence about the action.
The following consonants are used (notice that only the both consonant change):

- **zd (st):** for direct evidence, eg when the speaker has seen the action
- **zv (sf):** for hearsay
- **zb (sp):** for inference
