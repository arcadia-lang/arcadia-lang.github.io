# Verbs

Arcadia's verbs dictate sentence structure, shaping syntax based on verb type.
The verb determines word order and conveys extensive grammatical information through **suffixes**, integrating **[mood][mood], [tense][tense], [aspect][aspect], and [person][person] distinctions**.

All personal verbs in Arcadia require a **focus**, which is always in the **nominative case**.
Each section specifies which case applies to an argument when **unfocused**.

Arcadia does not categorize verbs by **transitivity**; instead, it distinguishes six core **verb types**:

- [Stative verbs](#stative-verbs)
- [Locative verbs](#locative-verbs)
- [Possessive verbs](#possessive-verbs)
- [Experiential verbs](#experiential-verbs)
- [Cognitive verbs](#cognitive-verbs)
- [Action verbs](#action-verbs)

## Stative verbs { #stative-verbs }

Stative verbs describe **states**, **properties**, **relationships**, **existence**, or **natural phenomena**.
They can be either static (e.g., _"The sky is blue"_, _"My friend is sick"_) or mutating (e.g., _"The ice is melting"_, _"The flowers are blooming"_).

### Syntax

The syntax is **Verb - Entity - State (in) - State (from) - State (to)**.

### Pivot

- Verbs without an entity, they may optionally lack pivot, in which case, they **do not take personal suffixes**.

### Examples

- _nivav._
    - It's snowing.

- _pluvav._
    - It's raining.

- _dormavi._:
    - You're sleeping.

## Locative Verbs { #locative-verbs }

Locative verbs **connect a subject to a predicate**, identifying or describing it (e.g., _"I am a doctor"_, _"The roses smell nice"_).

### Syntax

**Verb – Subject – Predicate**

### Pivot

- The **predicate** takes the **predicative case**, agreeing in **number** with the subject.
- The **subject is always in the nominative case** as it is the **only possible focus**.

### Examples

- _save la portis sanguadhi._:
    - The door is red.

- _save este dias lungi._:
    - This day is long.

## Possessive Verbs { #possessive-verbs }

## Experiential Verbs { #experiential-verbs }

Experiential verbs describe **preferences, sensations, or emotions** (e.g., _"I like apples"_, _"I feel cold"_, _"My foot itches"_).

### Syntax

**Verb – Experiencer – Stimulus**

### Pivot

- **Default focus:** **Experiencer**.
- **Unfocused experiencer:** **Absolutive case**.
- **Unfocused stimulus:** **Thematic case**.

### Examples

- _audavo las avisath._:
    - I'm hearing the birds.

## Cognitive Verbs { #cognitive-verbs }

## Action Verbs { #action-verbs }

Action verbs describe **physical or mental actions** (e.g., _"The birds are singing"_, _"I sold a book to Adam"_).

### Syntax

**Verb – Actor – Patient – Recipient**

### Pivot

- **Default focus:** **Actor**.
- **Unfocused actor:** **Ergative case**.
- **Unfocused patient:** **Accusative case**.
- **Unfocused recipient:** **Dative case**.

!!! note "Focus"

    Focus can be omitted, particularly for the **first, second, and fourth persons**.

### Examples

- _saltove la pueris._:
    - The child will jump.

- _legavo la librion._:
    - I'm reading the book.

- _donivo la librion marial._:
    - I'm giving the book to Maria.

## Focus Shifting

Arcadia allows **focus shifting** for experience and action verbs, achieved by modifying:

1. **The case of the focused argument**.
2. **The verb form**, as detailed in the **[verb generation guide][generation]**.

!!! note "Valid Focus Shifts"

    Apart from the basic focus, Arcadia allows following additional focus options:

    -   **Stimulus** for experiential verbs
    -   **Patient** for action verbs
    -   **Recipient** for action verbs
    -   **Instrument**
    -   **Beneficiary**

## Reflexivity and Reciprocity

Arcadia uses **prefixes** to indicate **reflexive** and **reciprocal** actions.
The reflexivity prefix is **applied first**, followed by the **focus-shifting prefix**, ensuring the reflexive element remains **closest to the verb root**.

The full set of reflexive and reciprocal markers is detailed in the **[verb generation guide][generation]**.
