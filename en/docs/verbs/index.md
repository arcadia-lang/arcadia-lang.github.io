# Verbs

Arcadia's verbs dictate sentence structure, shaping syntax based on verb type.
The verb determines word order and conveys extensive grammatical information through **suffixes**, integrating **[mood][mood], [tense][tense], [aspect][aspect], and [person][person] distinctions**.

All personal verbs in Arcadia require a **focus**, which is always in the **nominative case**.
Each section specifies which case applies to an argument when **unfocused**.

Arcadia does not categorize verbs by **transitivity**; instead, it distinguishes four core **verb types**:

- [Weather Verbs](#weather-verbs)
- [Linking Verbs](#linking-verbs)
- [Experiential Verbs](#experiential-verbs)
- [Action Verbs](#action-verbs)

## Weather Verbs { #weather-verbs }

Weather verbs describe **general states** without requiring a subject (e.g., _"It is raining"_).

!!! note "Name"

    Despite the name, these verbs extend beyond weather-related phenomena to **impersonal conditions**.

### Syntax

**Verb**

### Focus

- Since there is no subject, weather verbs **do not take personal suffixes**.

### Examples

- _nivav._
    - It's snowing.

- _pluvav._
    - It's raining.

## Linking Verbs { #linking-verbs }

Linking verbs **connect a subject to a predicate**, identifying or describing it (e.g., _"I am a doctor"_, _"The roses smell nice"_).

### Syntax

**Verb – Subject – Predicate**

### Focus

- The **predicate** takes the **predicative case**, agreeing in **number** with the subject.
- The **subject is always in the nominative case** as it is the **only possible focus**.

### Examples

- _save la portis sangi._:
    - The door is red.

- _save este dias lungi._:
    - This day is long.

## Experiential Verbs { #experiential-verbs }

Experiential verbs describe **states, sensations, or emotions** (e.g., _"I sleep"_, _"I feel cold"_).

### Syntax

**Verb – Experiencer – Stimulus**

### Focus

- **Default focus:** **Experiencer**.
- **Unfocused experiencer:** **Absolutive case**.
- **Unfocused stimulus:** **Thematic case**.

### Examples

- _dormavi._:
    - You're sleeping.

- _audavo las avisis._:
    - I'm hearing the birds.

## Action Verbs { #action-verbs }

Action verbs describe **physical or mental actions** (e.g., _"The birds are singing"_, _"I sold a book to Adam"_).

### Syntax

**Verb – Actor – Patient – Recipient**

### Focus

- **Default focus:** **Actor**.
- **Unfocused actor:** **Ergative case**.
- **Unfocused patient:** **Accusative case**.
- **Unfocused recipient:** **Dative case**.

!!! note "Focus"

    Focus can be omitted, particularly for the **first, second, and fourth persons**.

### Examples

- _saltove la pueris._:
    - The child will jump.

- _legavo la librion._:
    - I'm reading the book.

- _donivo la librion marial._:
    - I'm giving the book to Maria.

## Focus Shifting

Arcadia allows **focus shifting** for experience and action verbs, achieved by modifying:

1. **The case of the focused argument**.
2. **The verb form**, as detailed in the **[verb generation guide][generation]**.

!!! note "Valid Focus Shifts"

    Apart from the basic focus, Arcadia allows following additional focus options:

    -   **Stimulus** for experiential verbs
    -   **Patient** for action verbs
    -   **Recipient** for action verbs
    -   **Instrument**
    -   **Beneficiary**

## Reflexivity and Reciprocity

Arcadia uses **prefixes** to indicate **reflexive** and **reciprocal** actions.
The reflexivity prefix is **applied first**, followed by the **focus-shifting prefix**, ensuring the reflexive element remains **closest to the verb root**.

The full set of reflexive and reciprocal markers is detailed in the **[verb generation guide][generation]**.
