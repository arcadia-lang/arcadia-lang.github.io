# Person & Number

In Arcadia, verbs are conjugated using **person** and **number**, expressed through suffixes attached to the **verb stem**, after the **tense**, **mood** and **aspect** suffixes have been added.
The stem is formed by dropping the `-er` ending from the infinitive.

Arcadia is a **pro-drop** language: personal pronouns are omitted unless emphasis or disambiguation is required.

## Persons in Arcadia

Arcadia distinguishes **four grammatical persons**:

| Person | Description                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st    | Speaker (_I, we_)                                                         |
| 2nd    | Addressee (_you_)                                                         |
| 3rd    | Other(s) (_he, she, they_)                                                |
| 4th    | Non-personal agents (_collective forces, impersonal events, zero-agency_) |

Additionally, **1st person plural** distinguishes between:

- **Exclusive** (_we, not you_)
- **Inclusive** (_we, including you_)

## Conjugation Rule

Each conjugated verb form is built by attaching a **person vowel** and a **number consonant** to the **verb stem**.

### Suffix Composition

- Drop `-er` from the infinitive to obtain the stem
- Add the number suffix
- Add suffix: `[Person Vowel] + [Number Marker]`

### Example using **ser** (_to be_):

- _ser_ → _s-_ (stem extraction)
- _s-_ → _sa-_ (tense suffix)
- _sa-_ → _sav-_ (mood suffix)
- _savo_: I am
- _savas_: we (excluding you) are
- _savul_: everyone is
