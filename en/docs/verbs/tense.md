# Tenses

Arcadia distinguishes between **four verb tenses**:

- **One timeless tense** (not bound by chronological time)
- **Three timed tenses** (anchored in past, present, or future)

Tense indicates the **temporal framework** of a verb's action or state.
[Aspect][aspect], however, is handled separately via aspectual modifiers and is **not embedded** in the tense suffix.

Tense is marked by **vowel-based suffixes**, which are appended to the verb stem **after** the `-ir` infinitive ending is dropped, and **before** the person-number suffix.

## Timeless Tenses

Arcadia has one timeless tense, **veritas**, that captures states that **aren't bound by time**.

| Tense   | Suffix | Meaning                                |
| ------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Veritas | `-u`   | eternal statements, unaffected by time |

As such **veritas** is a tense used to describe **universal truths and scientific facts**.

## Timed Tenses

Timed tenses are tied to **a specific temporal frame**.

| Tense   | Suffix | Meaning                         |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Present | `-a`   | current action/state            |
| Past    | `-i`   | completed or prior action       |
| Future  | `-o`   | anticipated or projected action |

These suffixes are placed **after the stem** and **before** the mood suffix.

The best way to understand which tense to use is to consider the **viewpoint**.
The **viewpoint** is the temporal perspective from which the action or state is considered.
If the viewpoint is entirely in the past, the **past tense** is used.
If the viewpoint is entirely in the future, the **future tense** is used.
Otherwise, the **present tense** is used.

To illustrate this, consider the following sentence: "_Every morning, I go to work._"
The **viewpoint** is my current life pattern, which is ongoing and includes the present moment.
The **viewpoint** can have **specifiers**, for example, "_Every morning_" specifies the time frame of the action, but the **viewpoint** is always a continuum.

## Examples

- `save` → it is
- `sive` → it was
- `sove` → it will be
- `suve` → it was, it is, and it will be
