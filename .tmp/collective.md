## **Number Variation**

The collective article `ta` shifts meaning depending on the noun's number:

- **Singular** → Refers to a single collective unit (_a pride of lions_).
- **Plural** → Refers to multiple collective units (_prides of lions_).
- **Nullar** → Denotes **absence** of collectives (_no groups of lions_).
- **Total** → Covers **all possible collectives** (_all groups of lions_).

Most articles **do not have** nullar or total forms, as they typically specify **individual or generic instances** rather than collective concepts.
The **abstract article** `to` also lacks **fractional and plural forms**, reinforcing its conceptual function.

!!! note "Note on Articles"

    While Arcadia's **collective article** does not typically take a **fractional form**, speakers may **deliberately** bend this rule in **rhetorical or expressive contexts**.
    For instance, a teacher might say "_I have only half a class today_," even though a class **remains a singular unit regardless of absences**.
    In these cases, the fractional collective serves as a **marked statement**, emphasizing disruption or incompleteness rather than strictly following grammatical logic.
    This usage reflects the human tendency to reshape language for effect, making the grammatical "error" a deliberate stylistic tool rather than an oversight.
